# ergo-asset-locker

I started this mini-project of mine to help the community HODL. Yes, I intend to create a degen DApp that just time-locks your $ERG away so you can't touch it until the set time-lock is satisfied. The more I look into it, the more I tend to find other use cases.

Here are some of those:

Ultimate HODL Tool (initially)
DAO's vesting app. (if they want to lock tokens for the next month or so. Enable multi-sig?)
Security. Technically, they can't steal funds you don't even have! No more $5 wrench attack as both of you and your perpetrator has to wait for the time elected. LOL! But yeah, unlikely. Just use a cold wallet.
To further gamify:

Next iteration: Smart Contract will create a cryptographic key card in a form of NFT and send it to the original creator.
The Key Card NFT has the access to the locked funds so you can send it.
No more pins, and now it is transferrable! LOL.
Why? FOR FUN. That's it.
Why? FOR NFT's sake. FOR FLEXING! <Hey look, I locked 1,000 ERG for 10 years and this NFT proves it!> I wouldn't do that tho.
NOW you can use it as collateral! I know, I know. NFT that has actual value. We only have to create an NFT reader where it can show how much is locked and for how long each key card is.
Other ideas:

NFT Jailer - game creators can ban/lock an asset here forever.
NFT Release Countdown
Lock an ERG, and release it once the price hits $20 or when the 1yr time-lock expires.
Will and testament? Might be a long shot.
Alright folks, I hope you guys pick up from here.
Stay degen, stay creative.
